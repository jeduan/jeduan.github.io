title: Using Tweet Marker (when the best is not what's right for you)

<h1 style="display: none">abcde</h1>

There is little to no question right now about it: the best iPhone app for us, who started using Twitter more than a year ago is called [Tweetbot][tweetbot]. It is beautiful and a lot of thought has been put on its interactions so it's fast. If you use Twitter even casually and you have an iPhone, you should give it a try. At 2.99 it is a no-brainer.

However, it doesn't solve one of the most known first-world problems ever. How am I going to sync it, so that if I read some tweets on my Mac, I can continue from where I was?

And then, listening to [Enough][enough], a solution was thrown my way. Just change the client on the Mac. So as of a couple of weeks ago, I'm using [Twitterrific][twitterrific].

Twitterrific is one of the very first Twitter clients ever, and frankly, it kinda shows. It not as clean, or fast (it lacks a way to quickly go to a user profile) or pretty as Twitter for Mac. But it syncs the last tweet read with tweetbot using [Tweet Marker][mark]. And its growing on me. 

So there are times when better, is not always what you should use. Do you have any other example?
